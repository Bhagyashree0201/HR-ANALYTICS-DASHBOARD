# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD
To empower HR teams and decision-makers with a data-driven approach to understanding employee behavior, improving retention strategies, and enhancing organizational health.

This project presents a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI, designed to transform raw employee data into meaningful insights for strategic decision-making. Leveraging Excel as the data source, the dashboard visualizes key HR metrics such as total employees, attrition rate, active workforce, and average age. It includes interactive charts and tables that break down employee distribution by department, analyze job satisfaction levels, and highlight attrition trends across age groups, education levels, and gender. The dashboard empowers HR professionals to identify patterns in workforce behavior, assess departmental morale, and make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and engagement. Built with DAX for calculated measures and dynamic filtering, this project demonstrates the power of data visualization in human resource management and serves as a valuable tool for both analysts and decision-makers.
